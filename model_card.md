## Model Details

_Type, training/hyperparameters details, links to longer documentation - e.g., any papers relevant to the model._

## Intended Use

_Intend use and intended users_

## Data

_Including the training data and validation data. How it was acquired and processed_
_Between the model details and the data, the reader should have a good idea on how to reproduce a model._

### Training Data

### Evaluation Data

## Bias

Inherent either in data or model, this can also be included in the metrics or data section.

## Metrics
_Please include the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics._
_Metrics of how the model performs -- overall performance and key slices._
_A figure or two can convey a lot, such as learning curve._

## Ethical Considerations

## Caveats and Recommendations
